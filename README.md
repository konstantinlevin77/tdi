# To-Do Command Line Interface (tdi)

# Main Idea / Problem

Generally I take little notes in a to-do app to remember what should I do, but recently I've realized that the third party app that I use is too detailed for my use. Also when I develop something I'd like to use terminal to handle things so I've decided to make a to-do list CLI. 
**tdi** is not ready-to-use yet but it'll be ready as soon as possible.
